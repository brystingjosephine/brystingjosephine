- 👋 Hi, I’m @brystingjosephine
- 👀 I’m interested in cancer immunotherapies and identification of tumor-specific novel antigens.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to analyze mass spectometry data i.e. annotate novel proteins by associating peptides identified by mass spec with transcriptomes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on packages for analysis of mass spec datasets and for identifying and annotating proteins usine a transcriptome search database.
- 📫 How to reach me: josephine.brysting@embl.de.
